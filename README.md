## Supplier Invoice Process Transformation

This project presents a structured end-to-end redesign of a manual supplier invoice process into a governed, AI-enabled operating model. The transformation focused on improving efficiency, strengthening financial controls, and establishing a scalable digital finance capability rather than simply introducing automation.

The existing process relied heavily on manual data entry and sequential approval routing, resulting in long processing times, rework exposure, and limited performance visibility. A future-state model was designed incorporating OCR-based ingestion, AI-driven validation, rule-based approval routing, and exception-based human oversight. Structured audit logging and threshold controls were embedded to enhance governance integrity.

Financial modelling demonstrated a 67% reduction in processing time, a significant decrease in error rates, and an annual gross benefit exceeding £120,000, with a payback period of approximately fifteen months. A comprehensive enterprise risk and governance framework was developed to address operational, model, cybersecurity, fraud, and regulatory risks using a Three Lines of Defense oversight structure.

The project also includes a phased implementation roadmap and a post-deployment KPI monitoring framework to ensure sustainable performance and control maturity.

This repository demonstrates capabilities in process reengineering, financial modelling, enterprise risk management, and digital transformation strategy.
